## 🏰 Featured One-Shot: *Blinsky’s Last Laugh*

> Not long ago, the famed Barovian toymaker Blinsky inherited a fortune and opened a wondrous new toyshop on a man-made island in the middle of Lake Zarovich. A castle of joy for children and adults alike. Magical toys, fireworks, cheerful music—it was the talk of Vallaki.  
>  
> But something has gone terribly wrong.  
>  
> The boats have stopped returning, music has gone silent, and dazzling fireworks have vanished from the skies above Lake Zarovich. Worst of all—people are missing. Children. Nobles. Even Blinsky himself.  
>  
> You’ve just arrived at the island, at the request of worried townsfolk. The only sign of life? A blood-streaked ribbon lying limp at the toyshop’s grand entrance.  
>  
> Step inside Blinsky's Toyshop... if you dare!

**Adventure Highlights:**
- 🎠 Whimsical horror meets Barovian dread  
- 🧸 Haunted toys and cursed playrooms  
- 🧠 Puzzle encounters and emotional roleplay
